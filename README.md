This is the Pretium Finance App UI.
1. I have used go_router package for navigation
2. I have also used flutter riverpod (A state Management solution) for managing appwide state.
3. I have organized my folder in clean architecture, in order to have better code organization, and offer a good seoaration of concerns.

Note: I saw the link very late, like 7 hours after being posted, but I did as fast as i could.
